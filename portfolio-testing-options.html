              <h4>What problem was there to solve for the user?</h4>
              <p>
                I was in charge of a back-office product that our financial institution (FI) support teams and our internal support teams use. One of the sub-sites that our back-office product had was
                specifically for managing subscribers of financial institutions. The problem was in the newly added payment history section, where a support team member could quickly view a table of a
                subscriber's past payments.
              </p>
              <p>
                What became evident was that both our stakeholders and users were requesting different things to be shown in the payment history table. As you might guess, there are only so many
                columns you can add to a table before you start having issues.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9 mb-3">
            <h4>How I solved it</h4>
            <p>
              I wanted to focus on helping users and stakeholders prioritize the top five items they had to see on the payment history table out of a list of a dozen available items. My goal was to
              learn if there was a clear enough consensus on what must be displayed in the table before clicking on a row to see more details.
            </p>
            <p>
              I put together a survey and asked participants to rank their top five items in payment details they needed to see to quickly identify and gain enough insight before clicking to view all
              details. What was most interesting about the results was not my suspicions of a consensus reached being correct, but what was discovered when going over the results with the users and
              stakeholders in a follow-up meeting and interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              I presented my findings to spur further discussion and what was learned was that our stakeholders and FI users did not see eye to eye on the meaning of some of the terminology. For
              example, payment method and payment type were not used the same way, and depending on what definition was used, it was enough to change rankings. This taught me that there wasn't
              consistency in terminology and how some FI users viewed these inconsistencies in some of our other products. After getting clarification and providing newly agreed terminology
              definitions, I asked if a second round of the survey could be sent to get updated ranking results.
            </p>
            <h4>Round 2</h4>
            <p>
              After getting clarification and providing newly agreed terminology definitions, I asked if a second round of the survey could be sent to get updated ranking results. Results between the first and second rounds of surveys had minor changes, but once again, the discussion and interviews proved to be valuable. After further discussion, I recommended a potential solution based on the feedback; let the user of the product decide which fields were important to them and set them as the defaults on the payment history table.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <h4>The Way Forward</h4>
            <p>
              The major takeaways would not have been discovered if further discussion and interviewing had not happened.
I learned not only how to move forward with the original task, but also that we had to address inconsistencies in how we used terminology across our other products. More importantly, when possible, give the user the ability to customize their experience to their need.
